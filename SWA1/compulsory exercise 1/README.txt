COMPULSORY EXERCISE 1

Group members: Jan Fincke

I decided to create a web application for a clothing store to show its inventory items and display a simple
bar graph of the inventory items. You can add new items or remove the last item on the list. The bar graph updates in
real time when the user adds or deletes an item from the list.

You can also filter the list by typing e.g. a letter and then it would display
all the items beginning with the letter you typed in. You can also type the whole name.

This application uses the MVC design pattern for handling user interaction, the data the application uses etc. This
was a major struggle for me because the concept was new and it was difficult to put all the pieces together.
